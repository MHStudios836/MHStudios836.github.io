That's a lot of code to review! I've analyzed the core files you provided, focusing on the security of the admin and payment sections, as well as general structural integrity.

You've built a solid foundation using a modern stack (Eleventy + Tailwind) and the JAMstack security model (Firebase Auth). However, there are a couple of critical security flaws and some structural inconsistencies we need to address immediately.

Here is the "debug mode" analysis:

🛑 Critical Security Flaws (Must Fix Immediately)
The security of your application is currently relying on client-side JavaScript to hide or redirect users. This is not a secure practice for sensitive pages like Payment_Gateway.html and Admin_Room.html.

1. Payment Gateway: Simulating Transactions is Unsafe
File: Payment_Gateway.html

The Flaw: Your JavaScript block contains logic that appears to simulate a transaction or attempts to handle credit card data directly via a client-side form submission.

The code includes comments like // Simulate API call and a simulateTransactionDelay.

You must never handle sensitive financial data (like credit card numbers) in client-side JavaScript or store it yourself.

The Fix:

Use a PSP SDK: Integrate a Payment Service Provider (PSP) like Stripe or PayPal directly. Their SDKs handle the secure collection of payment details and convert them into a token.

Serverless Processing: The client-side token must be sent to a secure backend endpoint (like a Firebase Cloud Function) that then communicates with the PSP's server to process the payment.

Authentication Check: The current check for an authenticated user (onAuthStateChanged) is good, but it only validates who the user is, not the security of the transaction.

2. Admin Protection is Bypassed by Disabling JS
Files: Admin_Room.html, Admin_Room(Test_File).html, Admin_Room(Dummy_Backup).html

The Flaw: The logic to hide admin content (#admin-panel.hidden { display: none; }) and redirect unauthenticated users is all in JavaScript.

If a user disables JavaScript, they can access the raw HTML content, including sensitive dashboard elements, even if they can't execute the malicious actions.

The Fix:

Ultimate Gatekeeper: Firebase Security Rules: You should assume that any user can load Admin_Room.html. The real security is in your Firebase Firestore/Database Security Rules. These rules must check the user's ID (request.auth.uid) and their designated role (e.g., data.role == 'admin') before allowing them to read or write any sensitive data.

Server-Side Content: For truly sensitive content, consider using an Eleventy build step that relies on private data (not in your public repo) to generate the admin page.

🛠️ Structural & Pathing Debugging Notes
1. Inconsistent Admin/Login Pages
You have too many files that perform the same role, which is a major source of confusion and potential broken links:

Admin Pages: You have three versions of the Admin page (Admin_Room.html, Admin_Room(Test_File).html, Admin_Room(Dummy_Backup).html).

Action: Choose one (Admin_Room.html), finalize it, and delete the others. Use Git branches for testing, not duplicate files.

Login Pages:

The actual login file is DoD_Login_Style.html.

However, your Payment_Gateway.html redirects to Login_Signup.html.

Action: Ensure all links pointing to the login page use the correct file name, or set up an Eleventy alias/redirect so that Login_Signup.html points to the content of DoD_Login_Style.html.

2. Product Data (Efficiency Warning)
Files: Products_Services_Room.html and Product_Room.html

The Note: The Product_Room.html is using a local, hardcoded products array in its script.

Action: Since you are using Firebase, you should move this product data into a Firestore collection. This allows you to update inventory, prices, descriptions, and availability (available: true, quantity: 9999) without having to rebuild the entire website. This is the intended "API" part of your JAMstack architecture.

3. Tailwind & CSS Loading
Files: Product_Room.html and Products_Services_Room.html

The Note: These pages correctly load Tailwind CSS via CDN and then your custom assets/css/main.css. This is the correct order: base styling (main.css) loads first, and Tailwind utilities are available to override and supplement.

🚀 Next Steps
Decide on a PSP: Choose a payment processor (Stripe, PayPal) and investigate their client-side SDK and how to use Firebase Cloud Functions to handle the secure backend token exchange.

Implement Firebase Security Rules: This is the highest priority security task. Go to the Firestore/Realtime Database section of your Firebase Console and lock down all sensitive data (user roles, product inventory, etc.).

Standardize Filenames: Rename or delete your duplicate Admin_Room files and fix the login redirect link in Payment_Gateway.html to point to DoD_Login_Style.html.

Integrate Product Data: Move your product data from the HTML's inline JavaScript into Firebase and update the Product_Room.html script to read this data dynamically.
